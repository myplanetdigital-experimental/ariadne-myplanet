Myplanet Ariadne cookbook
=======================

This cookbook is intended to perform the "last mile" of configuration
needed to bring the Ariadne to a fully provisioned state for development
of the Myplanet Digital website.

Follow the instructions in Ariadne's official README to set up the
project.

Features
--------

  - This project makes use of the `clean=true` environment variable. To
    wipe the data and rebuild the site, simply run `clean=true vagrant
provision`. (Requires the "develop" branch of Ariadne.)
